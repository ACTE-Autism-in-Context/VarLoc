## 🧒 Participant Recruitment

**Study Title**: Acoustic variability in the learning of new words in children aged 7 to 10 years with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)  
**Identifier**: VarLoc  
**Study Dates**: May 2025 – September 2025  
**Funding**: ARC (Actions de Recherche Concertées – Université libre de Bruxelles)  

### 🧠 Summary

Recent research suggests that hearing a new word spoken by **multiple voices** (instead of just one) can enhance word learning in children. However, it is still unclear how this applies to children with **Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)**.

To explore this, we are recruiting:
- **Children aged 7 to 10** with a clinical diagnosis of **DLD**
- As well as **typically developing children** as control participants

The study consists of **two fun experimental sessions**, on two consecutive days. During each session, children will hear 12 invented words paired with visual images, spoken in either one or multiple voices, to assess **learning and memory across sleep**.
